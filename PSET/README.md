**Rule: Everyone on your team earns the same grade for all parts of the project.**

## Note on teammate evaluations (The exception to the rule above)

**Note**: If I get reports from all team members that someone did not do their fair share, I reserve the right to grade the entirety of that individual members project grade on a scale of 0-100 based on their contribution that will be separate from the rubric. 

- This would be a rare option I do not expect to use, but I want you to be good teammates to each other.
- Being a good teammate means: Being responsive, not waiting to the last minute to contribute (and otherwise communicating why that may need to happen), and giving your best effort.

## Notes on working in teams

* Pragmatically
	* It is useful to work in separate branches in git, and then merge your code to master, and then resolve the merge conflicts (ideally with the person you are working with).
	* If you are uncomfortable with this in github, then pair programming may be a viable option
* Note:
  	* I do **need** to see commits from everyone in the codebase. I do not grade based on 'most commits' (In fact, one person may have 10x the commits as another and that's fine) -- however, seeing no commits, or only commits at the very end of the project may require me to adjust your score if teammates report that you did not do your fair share in a timely manner.
* On working with others
	* Be responsive
		* Check your email, respond to your teammates within 24-48 hours on the preferred communication platform
	* Be proactive
		* Alert the course staff if there are issues sooner rather than later--we cannot do anything the last day before the project is due.
	* Contribute
		* The course staff looks at the commit logs to make sure everyone participated (No free rides--earn your grade!)
		* Note: One team member doing all the work is not heroic either
			* Balance the work load--no one should complete more than 50% of the project on a 4 person team for example.
