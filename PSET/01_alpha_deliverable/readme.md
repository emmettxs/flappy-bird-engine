# Alpha release

> A prototype that has the main mechanics


## Description

- At this point in the project, your goal is to have a prototyped version of your game. You should not be guessing what you are making, but have otherwise decided what you are going to make (e.g. "A 2D platformer like Mario", or "A flying space game").
- Your goal for this portion is to build a minimum viable product of the game you want to make, and prove to yourself the game can be made. You will also be documenting your code, so that your teammates can otherwise understand the work that you are doing.
- During this stage, you will also simultaneously be working on some of the tooling. For example, if you know you are making a '2D platformer' game, then you should otherwise delegate a team member to building the level editor, and perhaps agreeing on the output format of that data.

## A note on code documentation

Now that you are going to be maintaining the code for 'your game company' for many years (and working in a team), it is important to properly document your code. You can use either Doxygen or 'DDoc' <a href="https://dlang.org/spec/ddoc.html">(DDoc)</a> to document the source code and automatically generate .html pages. Your documentation should cover your classes and functions.

[Provided here are some notes/tutorials on how to document your code](./documentation.md)

An example of two well documented probjects can be found here:

## A work on 'why' we are documenting code?

There is some expectation that some of your final projects may actually develop and be released into commercial games over time. It is thus important to start the documentation process early enough, that if you decide to revisit this project, you will have a better chance at success with understanding your code. Regardless, documentation is important, especially documenting the 'why' and overall architecture of a project.
