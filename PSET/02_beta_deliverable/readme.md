# Beta Deliverable

> The feature complete version, just a few bug fixes and final touches before release! 

# Description

- At this point, you should have a game that is prototyped, and perhaps some primitive tooling.
- It is now time to continue working on the game and to start generating the required minimum of 3 scenes in your game.
  - Your team may at this time be otherwise doing refactoring of the engine to make it more data-driven, and otherwise taking time to clean up the code and fix bugs.
  - After the beta stage of your project, your project should generally be 'feature complete' as far as what you are trying to do with the engine.
    - Tooling, GUI's, etc. however may continuously add features and polish -- this is another advantage of seperating the engine from the tooling.

# Website
0
For your final project deliverable you will be creating a website that you can host on your portfolio. I might recommend peeking at the last portion of this project, and otherwise consider a free host like 'github pages' -- see [Creating a Github Pages Site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).

- You should create your website, and place a link to the 30 second video (see deliverables below) on your website showing the early progress under the headline '30-second progress video'.
- Please place a link to your website on the engine [../Engine](../Engine) page otherwise.
- Note: I recommend uploading your 30 second video to YouTube, Google Drive, or Vimeo so that it will persist. Please make sure I can view the video (i.e. make sure it is not private, and you can view it without being logged in).

## Deliverables

- [ ] You should have a github pages site (or some other webhost) with at the least a link on the website to your video describing your progress.
  - This does not have to be a fancy website, but otherwise you should establish having a website hosted somewhere with a link to your video.
- [ ] You should have a short video (~30 seconds) of your progress on your game and your editor.
  - Your video may show you generating some data (e.g. a level) in a level editor, and then that data being loaded into your game engine. It does not need to be feature complete, but otherwise I need to see that you have otherwise made progress on your project (e.g. the graphics, having a pipeline of getting data into your game engine, etc.)
