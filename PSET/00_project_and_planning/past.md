### Commercial Game Engine Examples

See below some example game making tools for inspiration:

- Look on the left panel to see the API for the Love2D engine: 
   - https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page
- Look at Gamemakers API for inspiration of what commands are exposed. 
   - [http://docs2.yoyogames.com/](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/)
- Here is a brief example showing integrating an API (through a console interface) with a script language to make changes and build a game in realtime.
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8RyQSvmrEU
- Here is the GODDOT engine, showing how to integrate playing a game in an editor. I would look to GoDot and GameMaker as inspiration.
