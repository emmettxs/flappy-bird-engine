# Final Deliveralbe

> This is the final release for the public!

## Description

- At this point you should be nearly done with your game and engine.
- Now we will want to put together everything that you have done (Your game engine, game, tooling, and supporting website).

## Website

This part is about showing off your work by **building a website** for your portfolio. Read the instructions below for what is needed.

Here are some examples of what I expect:
- https://bruggles718.github.io/ (Has everything, could perhaps be polished a bit, but this was overall an A+ project).
- https://hellowurld.notion.site/Bobotron-Game-Engine-f71ba78eac894dbfa16999e796347a65 (Has all of the requirements).
- https://lucasandoval.github.io/TinyShooterEngineWebsite/ (**This is the nicest designed of the 3 websites** -- this will show better on your portfolio)

### Task 0 - Engine Architecture Diagram

- [ ] Your project website should have an 'engine architecture' diagram which visually shows the major components of the engine. Think of this as a high-level diagram you would give an engineer the first day of work so they would know the components and how they interact if they want to modify the engine. 
   - Note: Some IDEs can automatically generate these diagrams, though you can draw it yourself and highlight the most important components. See [./media/C4Engine.pdf](./media/C4Engine.pdf) as an example. 
   - Note: An 'inhertiance hierarchy' is not the same as a high level 'engine architecture diagram' -- I want to see the 'abstraction layers' and 'systems' implemented. For this course it may not be as detailed as the C4 Engine -- but I should still see some major system components (e.g. run-time game loop. resource manager, scene system, etc.)

### Task 1 - Documentation

- [ ] You should upload your doxygen or ddoc source code documentation and do a build for your website of the final product.

### Task 2 - Build (binary file)

- [ ] You need to have a compiled binary of your game for your operating system (Either Windows, Mac, or Linux).
   - You can assume a target audience of either a 64-bit Mac, Ubuntu Linux, or a Windows 10/11 machine. There should additionally be instructions about how to compile your code from source. The compilation should be trivial (running `dub` for example, or listing a series of 'apt-get install' in a single bash script you have built. **Make it trivial** so customers/course staff do not get frustrated :) ).

### Task 3 - Post mortem

- [ ] Your website should have a brief postmortem.
   - A post mortem in games is a look back at what could be improved. Write a brief (2-3 paragraphs) on what could be improved if you had an additional 8 weeks to work on this project. Where would you allocate time, what tools would you build, would you use any different tools, etc. Think of this section as a good 'reflection' for what you can improve on your next project you complete, or if you otherwise decide to work further on this project later on.

### Task 4 - Website

I think it is incredibly important to build a portfolio of your game development works! You will be building out your final  1-page website (it can be all html and simple) to market your final project (Note: You could re-use this template for your next project, and potentially other personal projects).

The following are the requirements for a 1-page .html website.

1. Provide a 2-3 minute video trailer (preferably a link or embedded YouTube Video) followed by at least 3 screenshots of your game (order matters, video first, then screenshots below)
   - Your video should highlight the data-driven nature of your final project (show your engine and tools in use alongside the game)
   - Your video should otherwise include your 'narration' of your project (i.e. I should hear one or more of your teammates talking, not just music playing).
   - You do not need to keep the 30-second progress video from the beta on this website unless you'd like to move it to the very end.
3. Your documentation (i.e. a link to your doxygen generated files)
4. **An image** of your engine architecture.
5. A link to your binary
6. A short post mortem (i.e. A few paragraphs describing how you would take the project further, what went well, and what you would change if given another month on the project) should be put together on a 1-page .html page.
7. **DO not** make the course staff install 'npm' and run your website locally -- just provide a simple link to a one-page website that is hosted online (or otherwise local html page that can be downloaded).
8. If you are hosting your website online (which I encourage), make sure to visit your link (e.g. Incognito/private mode) to make sure that I will also be able to visit the website and have access to all links provided.

Note: This website will be the first place I look to grab your project files and binaries. 

### Task 5 - Final Team member evaluations
